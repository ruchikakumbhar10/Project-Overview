# Upcoming Projects Dashboard (SQL + Power BI) 🚀

This project demonstrates how to integrate **SQL** for data preparation and **Power BI** for data visualization by building an **Upcoming Projects Details Dashboard**.  

I worked with **5 different tables**, performed advanced SQL queries (CTEs, Window Functions, Group By, Aggregations, etc.), and then visualized the cleaned dataset in Power BI.

## 🔎 Overview
The main objective of this project was to analyze **upcoming project details** and create a clean, interactive **dashboard** using Power BI. SQL was used for data extraction and transformation, while Power BI was used for designing interactive reports.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Total **5 tables** provided in the raw dataset.  
- Tables included project-related details such as project IDs, managers, timelines, statuses, and other metadata.  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation were done using SQL queries.  

---

## 🛠 SQL Process
I used SQL extensively for:
- **SELECT statements** → Extracting key columns  
- **JOINS** → Combining data from multiple tables  
- **GROUP BY & Aggregations** → Summarizing project information  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** → Organizing complex queries  
- **Window Functions** → Ranking, ordering, and calculating running totals  

The final query result was exported into Power BI for visualization.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The **Upcoming Projects Dashboard** was designed to provide insights such as:
- ✅ List of upcoming projects with details  
- 📅 Project timelines and deadlines  
- 👨‍💼 Manager / department-wise distribution  
- 📊 Project status tracking  
- 🔍 Interactive filters & slicers for easy navigation

## ✨ Key Learnings
- Combining **SQL (data preparation)** and **Power BI (visualization)** for end-to-end analysis  
- Using **advanced SQL** features (CTEs, window functions) for efficient querying  
- Building **interactive dashboards** that highlight important business insights
